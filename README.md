### Hi there 👋

I *try* to make fast 🚀 and accessible ♿️ applications and am really curious about GraphQL and decoupled applications with JavaScript these days. I've started to try and give back by contributing to open source projects recently ♥️.

#### More stuff about me 🏌️‍♂️
🚵🏾‍♂️ Working on a lot of JAMStack projects, especially with WordPress as a data source.

📕 Learning GraphQL, TypeScript and Laravel
