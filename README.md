### Hi there 👋

I make fast 🚀 and accessible ♿️ applications and am really curious about GraphQL and decoupled applications with JavaScript these days. I've started to try and give back by contributing to open source projects recently ♥️.

* 🚵🏾‍♂️ I'm currently working on a lot of JAMStack projects, especially with WordPress as a data source.
* 📕 I'm currently learning GraphQL, TypeScript and Laravel
